# COMP2021_Project_Group11

The source code files are inside the src folder.

Main Task Management System is in TMS.java.

The Main Function to run the programme is the Application.java.

TMSTest.java is used for testing the system...

Notice that the GUI.java is developed in a short time, so it is not perfect.

Meanwhile, we have not been able to write a test method for the GUI.java, which means that it decreases our line-coverage rate dramatically.

To whom it may concern, please do us a favor. 
If we can get a full mark for implementing the GUI, we will be very grateful, and we are willing to give up the marks for line-coverage rate.
Otherwise, could you please exclude the GUI.java out of our testing and only grade the project base on the rest of the requirements?

We admitted that the structural design of two BONUS requirement (redo, undo and GUI) is not satisfying.
It is not a good OOP design due to time limit. However, we have tried our best to make it work.
Could you please do us another favor to grade our code quality only base on the basic requirements of the project?
